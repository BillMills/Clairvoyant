  //-----The PlotStyle() object-----------------------------
/*
  PlotStyle()  -no arguments
  

  Clairvoyant streamlines the plot styling process by wrapping all 
  style parameters in a PlotStyle() object.  PlotStyle() does nothing
  on its own, but an instance can be created and filled with plot
  styling options, and then passed as an optional argument to the
  draw() functions of most of Clairvoyant's other libraries.  In this way,
  the user may create a set of PlotStyle() templates in a project and
  re-use them to quickly and easily re-create the desired visual character
  in many figures without having to re-define the relevant parameters
  for each one.

  PlotStyle() currently provides control for the following 
  style elements (many more to come!):

  marginSize		size in pixels of the top, bottom and right margins (default 70)
  marginScaleY		left margin = marginSize * marginScaleY (to accommodate axis labels better, default 1.5)
  bigTick		length in pixels of large axis tickmarks (default 10)
  smallTick 		length in pixels of small axis tickmarks (default 5)
  majorX		number of large axis tickmarks to place on the x-axis (default 3)
  minorX		number of small axis tickmarks to place between each large axis tickmark on the x-axis (default 9)
  majorY                number of large axis tickmarks to place on the y-axis (default 3)
  minorY                number of small axis tickmarks to place between each large axis tickmark on the y-axis (default 9)
  color			line color (default black)
  suppress		1 implies suppress drawing axes and labels (used for drawing multiple things on same canvas, default 0).

  Clairvoyant creates a Plot() object every time one of the draw()
  methods in its other libraries is called.  The Plot() object is 
  responsible for drawing this axes, tickmarks and labels of a plot,
  but not the actual content in the plotting window.  It will typically
  not be called by the user, but we illustrate it here nonetheless:
